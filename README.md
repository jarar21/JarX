## 🚀 What is JarX?

JarX is a decentralized protocol designed to democratize the future of AI. We enable anyone to deploy, run, and profit from autonomous AI agents over a crypto-incentivized compute network—free from centralized control.

This isn’t just another token. JarX is laying the foundation for:

- Autonomous AI economies
- Decentralized fine-tuning & inference
- Permissionless compute marketplaces
- Token-governed protocol upgrades

## 🔮 Our Vision

> *“No borders. No gatekeepers. Just pure intelligence.”*

JarX aims to be the **Web3 backbone for AI** by offering:

- ⚙️ **Decentralized Fine-Tuning**
- ⚡ **Distributed Inference**
- 🤖 **Autonomous AI Agents**
- 🔐 **Privacy & On-Chain Governance**

We believe in an open ecosystem where AI isn't monopolized, but **shared and owned by the people** who build and use it.
